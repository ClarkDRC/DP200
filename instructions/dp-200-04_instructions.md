# DP 200 - Implementing a Data Platform Solution
# Lab 4 - Building Globally Distributed Databases with Cosmos DB

**Estimated Time**: 90 minutes

**Pre-requisites**: It is assumed that the case study for this lab has already been read. It is assumed that the content and lab for module 1: Azure for the Data Engineer has also been completed

**Lab files**: The files for this lab are located in the _Allfiles\Labfiles\Starter\DP-200.4_ folder.

## Lab overview

The students will be able to describe and demonstrate the capabilities that Azure Cosmos DB can bring to an organization. They will be able to create a Cosmos DB instance and show how to upload and query data through a portal and through a .Net application. They will then be able to demonstrate how to enable global scale of the Cosmos DB database.

## Lab objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Create an Azure Cosmos DB database built to scale
1. Insert and query data in your Azure Cosmos DB database
1. Distribute your data globally with Azure Cosmos DB
1. (optional) Build a .NET Core app for Azure Cosmos DB in Visual Studio Code

## Scenario
  
The developers and Information Services department at AdventureWorks are aware that a new service known as Cosmos DB recently released on Azure can provided planetary scale access to data in near real-time. They want to understand the capability that the service can offer and how it can bring value to AdventureWorks, and in what circumstances.

The Information Services department want to understand how the service can be setup and how data can be uploaded. The developers would like to see an example of an application that can be used to upload data to the Cosmos. Both would like to understand how the claim of planetary scale can be met.

At the end of this lad, you will have:

1. Create an Azure Cosmos DB database built to scale
1. Insert and query data in your Azure Cosmos DB database
1. Distribute your data globally with Azure Cosmos DB
1. (optional) Build a .NET Core app for Azure Cosmos DB in Visual Studio Code

> **IMPORTANT**: As you go through this lab, make a note of any issue(s) that you have encountered in any provisioning or configuration tasks and log it in the table in the document located at _\Labfiles\DP-200-Issues-Doc.docx_. Document the Lab number, note the technology, Describe the issue, and what was the resolution. Save this document as you will refer back to it in a later module.

## Exercise 1: Create an Azure Cosmos DB database built to scale

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

Individual exercise
  
The main task for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create an Azure Cosmos DB instance

### Task 1: Create an Azure Cosmos DB instance

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **+ Create a resource** blade.

1. In the New blade, navigate to the **Search the Marketplace** text box, and type the word **Cosmos**. Click **Azure Cosmos DB** in the list that appears.

1. In the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, click **Create**.

1. From the **Create Azure Cosmos DB Account** screen, create an Azure Cosmos DB Account with the following settings:

    - Subscription: the name of the subscription you are using in this lab

    - Resource group name: **awrgstudxx**, where **xx** are your initials

    - Account name: **awcdbstudxx**, where **xx** are your initials.

    - API: **Core(SQL)**

    - Location: the name of the Azure region which is closest to the lab location and where you can provision Azure VMs.

1. In the **Create Azure Cosmos DB Account** blade, click **Review + create**.

1. After the validation of the **Create Azure Cosmos DB Account** blade, click **Create**.

   > **Note**: The provision will takes approximately 5 minutes. What is often avoided in these labs is a description of the additional tabs when you provision any service in Azure. You may notice that in the provisioning screen there will be additional tabs such as Network, Tags or Advanced. This enables you to define any customized settings for a service. For example, the network tab of many services enables you to define the configuration of virtual networks, so that you are able to control and secure the network traffic against a given data service. The Tags option  are name/value pairs that enable you to categorize resources and view consolidated billing by applying the same tag to multiple resources and resource groups. Advanced tabs will vary dependant on the service that has it. But it is important to note that you have control over these areas and you wil want to collaborate with your Network admins or indeed your finance department to see how these options should be configured.

1. When the provisioning is complete, the "Your deployment is complete" screen appears, click on **Go to resource** and move onto the next exercise. 

>**Result** In this exercise, you have provisioned an Azure Cosmos DB Account

## Exercise 2: Insert and query data in your Azure Cosmos DB database

1. Your final App.config file looks similar to this.

    ```XML
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
        <configuration>
          <appSettings>
            <add key="accountEndpoint" value="https://my-account.documents.azure.com:443/" />
            <add key="accountKey" value="6e7sRxunccGEeO7IVlMdeFt5BdsllfSGLYc28KyjzkESiCu7tfWbTaZXAErt2v88gOcMbOYgwp1q4NYDifD7ew==" />
          </appSettings>
    </configuration>
    ```

1. At the terminal prompt, copy and paste the following command to run the program.

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

    > **Note**: The program displays Hello World! in the terminal.

1. In the Explorer pane, click Program.cs to open the file. Add the following to the beginning of the Program class.

    ```C#
    private DocumentClient client;
    ```

1. Add a new asynchronous task to create a new client, and check whether the Users database exists by adding the following method after the Main method.

    ```C#
    private async Task BasicOperations()
    {
        this.client = new DocumentClient(new Uri(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["accountEndpoint"]), ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["accountKey"]);

        await this.client.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync(new Database { Id = "Users" });

        await this.client.CreateDocumentCollectionIfNotExistsAsync(UriFactory.CreateDatabaseUri("Users"), new DocumentCollection { Id = "WebCustomers" });

        Console.WriteLine("Database and collection validation complete");
    }
    ```

1. In the integrated terminal, again, copy and paste the following command to run the program to ensure that the code runs. "Hello World!" is returned in the console.

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

1. Copy and paste the following code into the Main method, overwriting the current **Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");** code:

    ```C#
    try
    {
        Program p = new Program();
        p.BasicOperations().Wait();
    }
    catch (DocumentClientException de)
    {
        Exception baseException = de.GetBaseException();
        Console.WriteLine("{0} error occurred: {1}, Message: {2}", de.StatusCode, de.Message, baseException.Message);
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        Exception baseException = e.GetBaseException();
        Console.WriteLine("Error: {0}, Message: {1}", e.Message, baseException.Message);
    }
    finally
    {
        Console.WriteLine("End of demo, press any key to exit.");
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
    ```

1. In the integrated terminal, again, copy and paste the following command to run the program to ensure it runs.

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

### Task 3: Create, read, update, and delete NoSQL data programmatically

#### Create Documents

1. Create a **User** class that represents the objects to store in Azure Cosmos DB. We will also create **OrderHistory** and **ShippingPreference** classes that are used within **User**. Note that documents must have an Id property serialized as id in JSON.

1. To create these classes, copy and paste the following **User**, **OrderHistory**, **ShippingPreference** and **CouponsUsed** classes underneath the **BasicOperations** method.

    ```C#
    public class User
    {
        [JsonProperty("id")]
        public string Id { get; set; }
        [JsonProperty("userId")]
        public string UserId { get; set; }
        [JsonProperty("lastName")]
        public string LastName { get; set; }
        [JsonProperty("firstName")]
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        [JsonProperty("email")]
        public string Email { get; set; }
        [JsonProperty("dividend")]
        public string Dividend { get; set; }
        [JsonProperty("OrderHistory")]
        public OrderHistory[] OrderHistory { get; set; }
        [JsonProperty("ShippingPreference")]
        public ShippingPreference[] ShippingPreference { get; set; }
        [JsonProperty("CouponsUsed")]
        public CouponsUsed[] Coupons { get; set; }
        public override string ToString()
        {
            return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(this);
        }
    }

    public class OrderHistory
    {
        public string OrderId { get; set; }
        public string DateShipped { get; set; }
        public string Total { get; set; }
    }

    public class ShippingPreference
    {
        public int Priority { get; set; }
        public string AddressLine1 { get; set; }
        public string AddressLine2 { get; set; }
        public string City { get; set; }
        public string State { get; set; }
        public string ZipCode { get; set; }
        public string Country { get; set; }
    }

    public class CouponsUsed
    {
        public string CouponCode { get; set; }

    }

    private void WriteToConsoleAndPromptToContinue(string format, params object[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(format, args);
        Console.WriteLine("Press any key to continue ...");
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
    ```

1. In the integrated terminal, again, copy and paste the following command to run the program to ensure it runs.

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

1. The following result should be displayed

    ```text
    Database and collection validation complete
    End of demo, press any key to exit.
    ```

1. Now copy and paste the **CreateUserDocumentIfNotExists** task under the **WriteToConsoleAndPromptToContinue** method at the end of the Program.cs file.

    ```C#
    private async Task CreateUserDocumentIfNotExists(string databaseName, string collectionName, User user)
    {
        try
        {
            await this.client.ReadDocumentAsync(UriFactory.CreateDocumentUri(databaseName, collectionName, user.Id), new RequestOptions { PartitionKey = new PartitionKey(user.UserId) });
            this.WriteToConsoleAndPromptToContinue("User {0} already exists in the database", user.Id);
        }
        catch (DocumentClientException de)
        {
            if (de.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.NotFound)
            {
                await this.client.CreateDocumentAsync(UriFactory.CreateDocumentCollectionUri(databaseName, collectionName), user);
                this.WriteToConsoleAndPromptToContinue("Created User {0}", user.Id);
            }
            else
            {
                throw;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Then, return to the **BasicOperations** method and add the following to the end of that method.

    ```C#
    User yanhe = new User
    {
        Id = "1",
        UserId = "yanhe",
        LastName = "He",

### Task 4: Query using the Azure Cosmos DB .NET Core SDK

1. The following sample shows how a query could be performed in SQL, LINQ, or LINQ lambda from your .NET code. Copy the code and add it after **private async Task CreateUserDocumentIfNotExists** towards the end of the Program.cs file.

    ```C#
    private void ExecuteSimpleQuery(string databaseName, string collectionName)
    {
        // Set some common query options
        FeedOptions queryOptions = new FeedOptions { MaxItemCount = -1, EnableCrossPartitionQuery = true };

        // Here we find nelapin via their LastName
        IQueryable<User> userQuery = this.client.CreateDocumentQuery<User>(
                UriFactory.CreateDocumentCollectionUri(databaseName, collectionName), queryOptions)
                .Where(u => u.LastName == "Pindakova");

        // The query is executed synchronously here, but can also be executed asynchronously via the IDocumentQuery<T> interface
        Console.WriteLine("Running LINQ query...");
        foreach (User user in userQuery)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("\tRead {0}", user);
        }

        // Now execute the same query via direct SQL
        IQueryable<User> userQueryInSql = this.client.CreateDocumentQuery<User>(
                UriFactory.CreateDocumentCollectionUri(databaseName, collectionName),
                "SELECT * FROM User WHERE User.lastName = 'Pindakova'", queryOptions );

        Console.WriteLine("Running direct SQL query...");
        foreach (User user in userQueryInSql)
        {
                Console.WriteLine("\tRead {0}", user);
        }

        Console.WriteLine("Press any key to continue ...");
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
    ```

1. Copy and paste the following code to your BasicOperations method, before the **await this.DeleteUserDocument("Users", "WebCustomers", yanhe);** line.

   ```

>**Result** In this exercise, you have built a console application from scratch by setting up Visual Studio code to connect with Azure Cosmos DB. You have then created .Net code to create, read, update, and delete NoSQL data programmatically. You then added code to query the Cosmos DB and learned how to create programming objects such as Stored Procedures to work against Cosmos DB
