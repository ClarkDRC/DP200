**Estimated Time**: 75 minutes

**Pre-requisites**: It is assumed that the case study for this lab has already been read. It is assumed that the content and lab for module 2: Working withData Storage has also been completed

**Lab files**: The files for this lab are located in the _~\Labfiles\Starter\DP-200.5_ folder.

## Lab overview

The students will be able to provision an Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse and be able to issue queries against one of the instances that are created. They will be also be able to integrate SQL Data Warehouse with a number of other Data platform technologies and use PolyBase to load data from one data source into Azure SQL Data Warehouse.

## Lab objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Use Azure SQL Database
1. Creating and Querying an Azure SQL Data Warehouse
1. Using PolyBase to Load Data into Azure SQL Data Warehouse

## Scenario
  
You are the senior data engineer at AdventureWorks, and you are working with your team to transition relational database systems from on-premises SQL Servers to relational database located in Azure. You will begin by creating an instance of SQL Server with the company's sample database that will be handed of the junior data engineers to perform some testing of departmental databases.

You will then provision a SQL Data Warehouse and test that the provisioning of the server is successful by testing a sample database with a series of queries. You will then use PolyBase to load dimension tables from Azure Blob and Azure Databricks to test that the integration of these data platform technologies with Azure SQL Data Warehouse.

At the end of this lad, you will have:

1. Use Azure SQL Database
1. Creating and Querying an Azure SQL Data Warehouse
1. Using PolyBase to Load Data into Azure SQL Data Warehouse

> **IMPORTANT**: As you go through this lab, make a note of any issue(s) that you have encountered in any provisioning or configuration tasks and log it in the table in the document located at _\Labfiles\DP-200-Issues-Doc.docx_. Document the Lab number, note the technology, Describe the issue, and what was the resolution. Save this document as you will refer back to it in a later module.
